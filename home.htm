				<h3> About me </h3>
				<p> I am a junior studying Computer Science and Mathematics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. On campus, most of my time is devoted to extracurricular activities and studying for classes. I am involved in a professional organization known as the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE) and was recently elected to be a Student Senator of my class. <br><br>

				In the remaining time, I enjoy writing software and trying out new recipes. Some of my other hobbies include weightlifting, running, and playing ping-pong and basketball. I also follow the NBA and NFL, and I am a fan of the Sixers and Eagles. </p>
